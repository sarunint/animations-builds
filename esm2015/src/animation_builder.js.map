Use the `build()` method to create a programmatic animation using the\n * `animate()` function. The method returns an `AnimationFactory` instance.\n *\n * 2. Use the factory object to create an `AnimationPlayer` and attach it to a DOM element.\n *\n * 3. Use the player object to control the animation programmatically.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // import the service from BrowserAnimationsModule\n * import {AnimationBuilder} from '@angular/animations';\n * // require the service as a dependency\n * class MyCmp {\n *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}\n *\n *   makeAnimation(element: any) {\n *     // first define a reusable animation\n *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([\n *       style({ width: 0 }),\n *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))\n *     ]);\n *\n *     // use the returned factory object to create a player\n *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);\n *\n *     player.play();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport abstract class AnimationBuilder {\n  /**\n   * Builds a factory for producing a defined animation.\n   * @param animation A reusable animation definition.\n   * @returns A factory object that can create a player for the defined animation.\n   * @see `animate()`\n   */\n  abstract build(animation: AnimationMetadata|AnimationMetadata[]): AnimationFactory;\n}\n\n/**\n * A factory object returned from the `AnimationBuilder`.`build()` method.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport abstract class AnimationFactory {\n  /**\n   * Creates an `AnimationPlayer` instance for the reusable animation defined by\n   * the `AnimationBuilder`.`build()` method that created this factory.\n   * Attaches the new player a DOM element.\n   * @param element The DOM element to which to attach the animation.\n   * @param options A set of options that can include a time delay and\n   * additional developer-defined parameters.\n   */\n  abstract create(element: any, options?: AnimationOptions): AnimationPlayer;\n}\n"]}
